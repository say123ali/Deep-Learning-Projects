C25000 LUNG AND COLON HISTOPATHOLOGICAL IMAGE DATASET

The dataset contains color 25,000 images with 5 classes of 5,000 images each. All images are 768 x 768 pixels in size and are in jpeg file format. Our dataset can be downloaded as a 1.85 GB zip file LC25000.zip. After unzipping, the main folder lung_colon_image_set contains two subfolders: colon_image_sets and lung_image_sets.

The subfolder colon_image_sets contains two secondary subfolders: colon_aca subfolder with 5000 images of colon adenocarcinomas and colon_n subfolder with 5000 images of benign colonic tissues.

The subfolder lung_image_sets contains three secondary subfolders: lung_aca subfolder with 5000 images of lung adenocarcinomas, lung_scc subfolder with 5000 images of lung squamous cell carcinomas, and lung_n subfolder with 5000 images of benign lung tissues.
